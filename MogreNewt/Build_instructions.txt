
Some instructions for compiling MogreNewt.
======================================================


It's recommend to use the MogreBuilder (with option "-mogrenewt") for some preparations.


1)
Call MogreBuilder with the option "-mogrenewt". 
It builds Mogre, download the MogreNewt sources and creates some needed subdirectories.



2)
Call MogreBuilder again with the option "-mogrenewt -onlyaddons"
It doesn't build Mogre again, but copies some needed files to the MogreNewt subdirectories. 



3)
Download the needed filed of the Newton library. 

You find them here:
https://bitbucket.org/mogre/mogreaddons/downloads/MogreNewt__Newton_binaries_2.35.zip

If the link is dead, look here:
https://bitbucket.org/mogre/mogreaddons/downloads
http://code.google.com/p/newton-dynamics/downloads/list

Copy the files of the zip package to the directory "input_Newton".

You find this directory at this path:
<MogreBuilderTargetDirectory> \ MogreAddons \ MogreNewt \ MogreNewt_Main \ input_Newton



4)
Open the file "MogreNewt_VS2010.sln" with Visual Studio and compile it.

Important: 
Choose the "Release" build setting before you build. 
You can do this by the ComboBox below the menu of Visual Studio. 
Otherwise you will get a "Mogre_d.dll not found" error.



5)
Copy the files "MogreNewt.dll" AND "newton.dll" to the binary directory your project. 

"newton.dll" you find here:
<MogreBuilderTargetDirectory> \ MogreAddons \ MogreNewt \ MogreNewt_Main \ input_Newton

"MogreNewt.dll" you find here:
<MogreBuilderTargetDirectory> \ MogreAddons \ MogreNewt \ MogreNewt_Main \ lib \ Release
