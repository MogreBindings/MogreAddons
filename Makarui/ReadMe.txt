Makarui (Managed Akarui)
-------------------------

this is a wrapper around the akarui plugin. unlike hikari, akarui is not bound to ogre, so the binding to mogre is directly done on Makarui.

The main advantage of this wrapper is that you can use any version of the flash plugin, it work with flash 9, 10. 

keep in mind this is an early version, all the main functionality works, but some part (like setting transparency, play(), stop(), rewind() command ...) don't work, mainly because they haven't been implemented in akarui.
