
   MogreDesignSupport alias PROPERTY GRID
================================================

This is a short information about this add-on.

Project start:  April 2009
Author:  Koirat      --> seems to be retired, but possibly gives still support in the forum. 

Koirat had some need to be able to edit Mogre types objects in a PropertyGrid. 
He prepared some useful classes to allow such a possibility.
The goal was to make TypeConverter and UITypeEditor that would present 
different functionality depending on underling object. 
In addition this functionality can be changed at run-time.
